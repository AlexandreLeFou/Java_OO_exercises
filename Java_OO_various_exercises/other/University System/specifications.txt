In order to play around classes and methods (OO) I have created a
management system regarding a Private University Management.
The aim of this program is to calculate the expenses of a private university
based on the tuition fees of the students as well as the teachers' salaries.


->fields: students, teachers, amountOfMoney
->functionality: totalStudentFee, teacherSalary, totalStudentFeeRemain


//University object:
teachers, students, expensesBalance(earned/spent$)


//Teacher object:
name, tcardId, salary, age


//Student object:
name, stcardId, grade, paidTuition
