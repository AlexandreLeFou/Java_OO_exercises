Exercise :

Letâ€™s try to model the following universe:
A Wallet is represented by the amount of money it contains. What one can do with a wallet is to deposit money, thus increasing the stored amount by the value of a parameter N, or withdraw, which does the opposite. A Person is represented by their name and has also a wallet with $500 at first. A person can make a purchase of a certain price using their wallet, decreasing the amount of money as a result.
