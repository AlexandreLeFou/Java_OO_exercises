Basic Project from Udacity's OO in Java
Name:Guess The Movie

Description: This is a simple console game where the player gets to guess the movie name given the number of letters in it (pretty much like hangman but with movies)! The rules are simple, the computer randomly picks a movie title(from a text), and shows the user how many letters it's made up of. The user's goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time. If a letter is indeed in the title the computer will reveal its correct position in the word. After 10 efforts the game is over! The more correct letters the user predicts the more obvious the movie becomes ... The program randomly picks each time a movie title from the text file included to the folder which was downloaded from here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/December/5a3732ea_movies/movies.txt
